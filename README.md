# HandAndFoot
I wanted to make an online version of the popular card game, Hand and Foot.

##Rules of the Game
For 3 or more players
A full game consists of 4 rounds, determined by the "melt" which will be described later.
Players will be delt 2 stacks of cards each, a "hand" and a "foot." You must play or discard all cards in your hand before playing your foot.  Play consists of drawing cards, making books, and discarding. 
On their turn, a player will first draw two cards.  The player may lay down on the table any books of three or more similar cards (ex. 4, 8, K, A, etc.) regardless of suite. Players may NOT make a book of 3s, or the wild cards 2 and Joker.  The point total of the cards on initial lay down MUST equal or beat the afformentioned "melt."  The melt increases in point value per round, and are as follows: 50, 90, 120, 150.  Books will be closed when it reaches seven cards.  To win a round, the player MUST have closed a RED book and a BLACK book.  A RED book is a pure book, meaning seven of the same type of card, no wild cards.  A BLACK book is dirty, or has at least one wild card.  After a book has been closed, any extra cards that match the closed book may be saved to add points and serve to remove cards from the hand or foot in play.

##Scoring
After a player wins a round, all card point values are totaled for each player. Cards on the table are worth positive points, while any cards left in a players "hand" and "foot" are negative points.

Closed books are scored as follows: 
RED = 500pts 
BLACK = 300pts.

Open books are not scored, but individual cards are.  Card points are as follows:
4 - 8 = 5pts
9 - K = 10pts
  A   = 20pts
2(wild) = 20pts
Joker(wild) = 50pts
BLACK 3 (spade or club) = 300pts  These will always be negative as books cannot be made from 3s.
RED 3 (diamond or heart) = 500pts  These will always be negative as books cannot be made from 3s.
