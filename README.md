# Hand And Foot  :hearts: :clubs: :spades: :diamonds:
I wanted to make an online version of the popular card game, Hand and Foot.

## Rules of the Game :diamonds::hearts:
For 3 or more players\
A full game consists of 4 rounds, determined by the "melt" which will be described later.\
-Players will be delt 2 stacks of cards each, a "hand" and a "foot." You must play or discard all cards in your hand before playing your foot.  Play consists of drawing cards, making books, and discarding. \
-On their turn, a player will first draw two cards.  The player may lay down on the table any books of three or more similar cards (ex. 4, 8, K, A, etc.) regardless of suit. Players may NOT make a book of 3s, or the wild cards 2 and Joker.  The point total of the cards on initial lay down MUST equal or beat the afformentioned "melt."  The melt increases in point value per round, and are as follows:\
50 => 90 => 120 => 150\
-A wild card may be used as the third card to start a book.  A book may contain up to three wilds, but may never contain more wild cards than natural cards.  A book will be closed when it reaches seven cards.  To win a round, the player MUST have closed a RED book and a BLACK book, and DISCARD the last card in their foot.  A RED book is a pure book, meaning seven of the same type of card, no wild cards.  A BLACK book is dirty, or has at least one wild card.  After a book has been closed, any extra cards that match the closed book may be saved to add points and serve to remove cards from the hand or foot in play.\
-At the start of every turn the player must draw two cards, or may take the entire discard pile, however; the discard pile can only be taken if the top card can be used, and it MUST be used either to make the melt (if player hasn't layed down yet), or placed in an open book on the table, or to help lay down a new book.

## Scoring :spades::clubs:
After a player wins a round, all card point values are totaled for each player. Cards on the table are worth positive points, while any cards left in a players "hand" and "foot" are negative points.\
\
Closed books are scored as follows: \
RED = 500pts \
BLACK = 300pts\
\
Open books are not scored, but individual cards are.  Card points are as follows:\
4 - 8 = 5pts\
9 - K = 10pts\
  A   = 20pts\
2(wild) = 20pts\
Joker(wild) = 50pts\
BLACK 3 (spade or club) = 300pts  These will always be negative as books cannot be made from 3s.\
RED 3 (diamond or heart) = 500pts  These will always be negative as books cannot be made from 3s.
